# Artist's Statement

This turned out to be one of the toughest projects in terms brainpower and patience.

I really wanted to fulfill what I had envisioned for this game. Needless I feel like I accomplished most of what I desired.

My only regret is the lingering feeling that I could have worked some things a little better.

My project is quite messy and I tried to tidy it up as much as I can in terms of coding, but it's all I could with my current knowledge and the time given for the assignment.

I know that I could used something like arrays to duplicate the various objects as the recurring cubes and rectangles but I could not figure it out for the life of me.

I should have sought out more help, but I felt like I also wanted solutions in the immediate moment which my have hindered my progress and made it take longer than it should have.

Some of the object collisions are quite buggy and I wish I had the knowledge to work around them a little longer, but I could not spend too much time in one area as I had to move on. I am not too good with math and trying to figure out numbers which I'm guessing was mostly the problem.

As for the visuals, I straight up love how they turned out. As I mention a lot, I am more of an artist than a technical person, but learning how to code games and implement my assets into them has always been my dream and I hope to keep getting better at it and eventually be able to know it like the palm of my hand.

I have a ton of unused assets which I planned to incorporate into the assignment, but I felt like 10 levels sufficed in terms of the length of the project.

If given the opportunity, I would like to further develop this game into an actual 3D platformer using the WEB GL feature which has not been touched upon yet due to its more advanced nature.

My original idea of moving cubes around to use as platforms did not end up making it into this game, but I have an idea on how to accomplish it now and would like to implement it in the future.

I would also like to keep working on this game for CART263's big project if there is one; and if I pass this class of course.
